Stern-Volmer Analysis 
=====================

Fluorescence intensity measurements of an oxygen sensor are used to calculate oxygen concentration.  

Two-Site Model
-----
This model assumes two quenching environments. It is used to fit curved Stern-Vomer plots.

f1 and f2 are fractions that sum to 1. Each quenching environment has a respective Ksv.
